# ArduinokodLodestar

The code should allow the Arduino to be able to measure voltages and currents. By knowing the the current and voltage the Arduino should
make decisions to maximize the power output from the solar cells. This will be done by the 5V node of the Arduino emitting differing 
voltages and thereby altering the resistance in a MOSFET-transistor.
